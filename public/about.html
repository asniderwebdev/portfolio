<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been interested in computers and art since I was a child, 
  but only recently decided to integrate the two into a career in web development. 
  I am a full stack developer, with the ability to build websites from scratch. 
  I can write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience in visual design and copy editing, 
  bringing a wide variety of skills to this profession. 
</p>
<p>I hope that you email me today so that we can work together 
  to design your perfect personal or professional website.
